# Guiding Principles for the Evolution of FCOP

1. Policies may not be influenced by social media, with a mandatory cool down period of at least 60 days between an event on social media, and a reactionary change to FCOP.
2. Policies may only dictate behavior, not internal or external characteristics of members.
3. Policies may not promote any agenda other than the professional goals of the community, and as a component of this, continued participation in professional life for members.
4. Policies must guard against the formation of corrupt FCOP communities.
5. Policies must not attempt to eliminate the use of subjective human arbitration, only to limit its scope to well-defined boundaries.
6. Policies must not attempt to replace or extend the legal system in the country of jurisdiction, but must assume a functioning legal system that is responsible for handling all civil and criminal offenses.

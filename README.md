# Introduction

Every community makes decisions about who to allow into their community and about what sorts of behavior they encourage and discourage.

Code of Conducts (COCs) attempt to codify these decisions so that participants have a better understanding of what communities expect from them.

FCOP is a code of conduct designed specifically for _professional communities_.

Professional communities, unlike social communities and support groups, exist to serve a professional agenda, not a social or personal one.

Professional communities are inclusive and diverse. They do not take sides in religious or political matters. Above all, they are focused on ensuring that all civil individuals can come together and work productively in an environment with the highest standards of professionalism, regardless of differences between them inherent in pluralistic societies.

FCOP works well for professional events, open source projects, and other broad, open communities that are squarely focused on professional rather than social and personal goals.

To adopt FCOP in your professional community, you may reproduce the text of [COC.md](COC.md) in any format you desire, or simply link to this repository with [FCOP badge](badge-fcop.png).

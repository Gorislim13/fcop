# FAQ

### 1. Why is there a restriction against moralizing?

The restriction discourages people from pushing their religious, political, or personal ideology on other people in inappropriate contexts. This allows community members to focus on their shared professional goals. It does not prevent people from using moral language (such as, *PHP is a bad programming language*) as long as such language is concerned only with suitability for a purpose, rather than good and evil.

*Example*: Suppose that you are a woman instructor at an educational event, teaching a room full of men. If a conservative Christian believed it was sinful for you to teach or assume authority over a man, they would have to keep their religious opinions to themselves.

### 2. What types of violations will be reported publicly?

In an effort to warn other communities about bad actors, any violation that results in removal of a member may be reported publicly, including personally identifiable information (e.g. name, Twitter handle, etc.). If an arbiter does not believe a violation warrants removal, no information on the violation will be reported publicly. Members themselves are free to privately share such information with other communities and non-members.

### 3. Under what circumstances will someone be pro-actively prevented from participating in a community?

Community leaders must believe that every participant does not and will not engage in any form of criminal behavior, including assault, hate speech, and so on; and further, that they do not and will not sabotage the community or its members. If community leaders do not believe that an individual will satisfy these requirements, they will not allow participation of that individual, regardless of whether or not they have broken the terms and conditions.

### 4. What happens if someone is assaulted inside a community?

FCOP does not overlap with or supersede local jurisdiction. If anyone breaks any law you should immediately report them to the appropriate legal authorities. Community leaders can assist in the reporting process, but FCOP itself is only intended to cover and apply to legal behavior.

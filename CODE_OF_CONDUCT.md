# Fantasyland Institute of Learning - Code Of Professionalism (FCOP)

Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 Fantasyland Institute of Learning. All Rights Reserved.

## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to facilitate an inclusive and diverse _community_ of professionals who productively work toward shared professional goals.

In service of this purpose, we open the _community_ to all _civil_ individuals and we require that all _members_ refrain from _unprofessional behavior_. We do not impose any ideology onto _members_, nor do we restrict participation based on people's _personal attributes_ or their _behavior_ in other communities.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome all _civil_ individuals regardless of any _personal attributes_ they have that are orthogonal to the professional goals of the _community_.

We pledge that we will enforce the terms and conditions set forth in FCOP, and that we will hold ourselves to these same standards, thereby setting a positive example for others to follow.

## Expected Behavior

We permit only _civil_ individuals to participate in the _community_. We further require that _members_ refrain from _unprofessional behavior_.

### Active Participation

We encourage _members_ to assume the best in every _interaction_; to be open, honest, and empathic in all _communication_; and to demonstrate politeness and professional courtesy in every situation.

We welcome any closed group of _members_ to engage in any _behavior_ for which there is explicit and unanimous mutual consent. In the absence of such consent, we impose the following restrictions during _active participation_, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Discriminate**. Do not show or withhold favoritism on the basis of a _stereotype_.
* **Don't Harass**. Only _interact_ with people who wish you to _interact_ with them.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not attempt to infer the private content or _communication_ of others.
* **Don't Insult**. Do not _insult_ others or aspects of who they are.

These requirements on _behavior_ apply to _members_ only while they are actively participating in the _community_. The standing of _members_ is unaffected by _behavior_ that does not comply with these requirements if this _behavior_ occurs in other communities.

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, we impose the following restrictions, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Dox**. Do not publish details of _members_ that you learn about during _active participation_.
* **Don't Retaliate**. Do not _retaliate_ against _members_ for the resolution or reporting of an _incident_.

These requirements on _behavior_ apply to _members_ at all times, even when they are not actively participating in the _community_.

## Reporting

**Reporting Requirements**. _Active participation incidents_ must be reported to us within 15 days by _aggrieved members_. We will investigate third-party reports at our sole discretion. _Inactive participation incidents_ must be reported to us within 5 years of their occurrence, by _members_ or _non-members_. Information that any _member_ or _non-member_ believes may affect our view of the _civility_ of individuals may be reported at any time.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For unofficial resolution, we encourage _aggrieved members_ to speak to _accused members_ directly, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC). At the request of an _aggrieved member_, we will appoint a mediator who can facilitate an unofficial resolution and serve as a witness.

**Official Resolution**. For official resolution, _aggrieved members_ must contact us, and we will appoint an _arbiter_. The _arbiter_ will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the _incident_, or accepting it as a _violation_ and imposing a consequence on the _violator_.

**Consequences**. _Violators_ may be asked to apologize or to undergo training, counseling, or mediation as a condition of continued participation. They may also be banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the _arbiter_. In no case will the consequence exceed banishment, unless the violation is also governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws. We reserve the right to re-evaluate a previously imposed _consequence_.

**Social Rehabilitation**. We will only banish individuals for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties may be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. We may publicly share information about any _violation_ that results in banishment, including personally identifiable information on the violator, limited to name and online identities. We will keep other _incidents_ and the identities of _aggrieved_ and _accused_ confidential to the extent this confidentiality is fully respected by all parties.

## Management

**Contact Information**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to provide contact information for use in reporting _incidents, including an estimate of how quickly _members_ can expect to receive a response.

**Clear Boundaries**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to provide information on the boundaries of the _community_, including information on any regions in time or space that are partially or fully exempt from FCOP.

**Non-coercion**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to never coerce _members_ into revealing private information, making statements, or otherwise requiring actions that are unnecessary for the scope of participating in a given _community_ activity.

**Disclosure**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to provide a written, anonymized summary to _uncivil_ or banned individuals that discloses the rational and evidence resulting in their status. Such individuals may share this disclosure privately or publicly providing they do so in its entirety.

**Unbiased Arbitration**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to appoint balanced or neutral _arbiters_ for every arbitration, ideally without special relationships to _aggrieved_ or _accused_, or vested interest in any specific outcome.

**Merit Transparency**. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to communicate on whether the status, authority, or responsibility of individual _members_ is awarded or withheld based on _personal attributes_ that are not relevant to their function in the _community_.

## Miscellaneous

**Criminal Behavior**. FCOP is not intended to supplant the laws of governing jurisdictions, but to impose a set of terms and conditions on community membership. _Criminal behavior_ of any kind should be immediately reported to relevant authorities and dealt with as recommended by such authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if _criminal behavior_ also violates FCOP, we reserve the right to deal with such behavior as described herein.

**Disputes of Interpretation**. In the event there is a dispute about the meaning of any term or clause in FCOP, we alone will clarify the intent, independent of how other FCOP communities have made clarifications. We pledge to be consistent in our interpretation of any ambiguity, rather than utilizing different interpretations in different circumstances.

**Non-Endorsement**. In recognition of the pluralistic composition of the _community_, the _community_ does not endorse the views, values, religions, politics, beliefs, or attitudes of ourselves or of any _member_ of the _community_. No _member_ ever speaks for or represents the _community_, and neither do we speak for or represent the _community_ unless we are acting in our official capacities (and even then, only for the scope of the task at hand).

**Limitation of Remedy**. In the event we fail to uphold any of our obligations under FCOP, including upholding pledges as made herein, the remedy is limited to a formal public apology and reversal of any negative consequences, unless the breach is governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws.

**Amendments**. Any part of FCOP, including but not limited to definitions in the glossary, may be unilaterally amended by us, on condition that we clearly specify and distribute such amendments together with both FCOP, and any statements indicating we have adopted FCOP.

 * **Retaliation**. We define _retaliation_ as the imposition of any _negative consequence_ on a _member_ for their unofficial resolution or reporting of an _incident_, or for their participation in such resolution or reporting (including participation as _arbiter_), where _negative consequence_ is defined as any consequence that does or is intended to have the effect of harming the _member's_ career.

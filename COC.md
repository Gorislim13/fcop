# Fantasyland Institute of Learning - Code Of Professionalism (FCOP)

Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 Fantasyland Institute of Learning. All Rights Reserved.

## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to facilitate an inclusive, productive _community_ in the presence of pluralism. To accomplish this goal, we restrict the _community_ to _civil_ individuals, and protect such people from _discrimination_, _stereotyping_, _harassment_, _moralizing_, _denigration_, and breaches of privacy.

FCOP is explicitly not intended to impose any system of politics, religion, ideologies, morals, or values onto _members_, but rather, to allow people who do not share these systems to come together and work toward professional goals.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome all _civil_ people regardless of any _personal attribute_ that is orthogonal to the professional goals of the _community_.

We pledge that we will enforce the terms and conditions set forth in FCOP, and that we will hold ourselves to these same standards, thereby setting a positive example for others to follow.

We greatly value integrity and pledge to establish the highest levels of trust in _members_.

## Behavior

We only allow _civil_ individuals to participate in the _community_. Beyond civility, we place additional requirements on behavior during _active participation_ and _inactive participation_.

### Active Participation

We encourage everyone to assume the best in every interaction; to be open, honest, and empathic in all communication; and to demonstrate politeness and professional courtesy in every situation.

We welcome any closed group of _members_ to engage in any behaviors for which there is explicit and unanimous mutual consent. In the absence of such consent, we impose the following restrictions during _active participation_, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Stereotype**. Communicate as if every person were unique.
* **Don't Moralize**. Do not impose your moral system onto other others.
* **Don't Denigrate**. Do not denigrate the _personal attributes_ of others.
* **Don't Harass**. Do not interact with anyone who does not consent to the interaction.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not eavesdrop on the private communications of others.

These requirements on behavior apply to _members_ only while they are actively participating in the _community_. The standing of _members_ is unaffected by behavior that does not comply with these requirements if this behavior occurs in other communities.

However, if we become aware of behavior in another community that we believe implies a _member_ may not abide by the terms and conditions of FCOP in the _community_, then we reserve the right to take proactive measures to protect other _members_, including but not limited to warning _members_ and instituting oversight or monitoring of the _member's_ behavior in the _community_.

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, you must behave as required in this section, and as further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Dox**. Do not share personal details you learn about _members_ during _active participation_.
* **Don't Retaliate**. Do not _retaliate_ against _aggrieved_ _members_ for reporting an _incident_.

These requirements on behavior apply to _members_ at all times, even when they are not actively participating in the _community_.

## Violations

**Reporting Requirements**. _Active participation_ _incidents_ must be reported to us within 15 days by _aggrieved_ _members_. We will investigate third-party reports of such _incidents_ at our sole discretion. _Inactive participation_ _incidents_ may be reported to us within 5 years of their occurrence, by _members_ and _non-members_ alike. Information that any _member_ or _non-member_ believes may affect our view of the _civility_ of individuals may be reported at any time.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For minor offenses, and only in cases where they prefer doing so, we encourage _aggrieved members_ to speak to _accused members_ directly, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC).

**Official Resolution**. If you want an official intervention, we will appoint an _arbiter_. The _arbiter_ will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the _incident_, or accepting it as a _violation_ and imposing a consequence on the _violator_.

**Consequences**. _Violators_ may be asked to apologize or to undergo training, counseling, or mediation as a condition of continued participation. They may also be ejected and banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the _arbiter_. In no case will the consequence for violating FCOP exceed banishment, unless the violation is also governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws. We reserve the right to re-evaluate a previously imposed *consequence* based on new information or a change in community leadership.

**Social Rehabilitation**. We will only banish individuals for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties can be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. We will publicly share information about any _violation_ that results in banishment, including personally identifiable information on the violator, limited to name and online identities. We will keep other _incidents_ and the identities of _aggrieved_ and _accused_ confidential to the extent this confidentiality is respected by other parties.

## Member Rights

**Right to Contact Leaders**. _Members_ have a right to clear, up-to-date contact information for use in reporting _incidents_. _Members_ have a right to accurate estimation of how quickly _members_ will receive a response after an _incident_ is reported. We pledge to make reasonable efforts to make contact information accessible to all _members_ regardless of physical or intellectual disability.

**Right to Know Boundaries**. _Members_ have a right to clear communication on the boundaries of the _community_. In addition, if any regions in time or space are specially exempted from part or all of FCOP, _members_ have a right to clear communication on these exemptions.

**Right to Semi-Private Communication**. During _active participation_, _members_ have a right to take phone calls, direct messages, emails, and other semi-private forms of communication. Although private communication with people outside of the community is not bound by FCOP, all communication that can be discerned by other members must comply with the requirements of FCOP.

**Right to Private Consumption**. During _active participation_, _members_ may consume material on their own personal devices and from their own private channels of communication, and this material does not have to conform to FCOP, assuming the material is not easily discernible to others.

**Right to Non-Coercion**. _Members_ may not be coerced to share private information, make statements, or otherwise perform any function which is not essential for the scope of participating in a given _community_ activity.

## Non-Member Rights

**Right to Disclosure**. _Non-members_ who are prevented from participating in the _community_ on grounds of _incivility_ have a right to a full written disclosure of the rational resulting in the verdict. Further, such _non-members_ have the right to publicly share this disclosure.

## Expectations

**Illegal Behavior**. FCOP is not intended to supplant laws and regulations of applicable jurisdictions, but rather, to impose a set of terms and conditions on membership in a community that goes above and beyond legal requirements. Illegal behavior of any kind should be immediately reported to relevant authorities and dealt with as recommended by such authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if illegal behavior violates terms and conditions of FCOP, we reserve the right to subject such behavior to arbitration.

**Disputes**. In the event there is a dispute about the meaning of any term or clause in FCOP, we alone will clarify the intent. We pledge to be consistent in our interpretation of any ambiguity, rather than utilizing different interpretations in different circumstances.

We define _community sabotage_ to be any behavior that does have or is intended to have the effect of harming the professional goals of the _community_, including but not limited to attempting to defund or blackball the _community_, attempting to disrupt or diminish the activities of the _community_, and authoring, spreading, or endorsing libel or slander about the _community_. Explicitly excluded from this definition is _communication_ of truthful information regarding the _community_ and truthful criticism on the failure of the _community_ to optimally achieve its professional goals.
 * **Denigration**. We define _denigration_ as the _communication_ of the idea that any _personal attribute_ of any person is superior or inferior to any other.

 * **Professional Sabotage**. We define _professional sabotage_ to be any behavior that does have or is intended to have the effect of harming a _member's_ career for any reason that is unrelated to the _member's_ performance in their professional duties, including but not limited to attempting to no-platform, blackball, or fire a _member_ because of any _personal attribute_ orthogonal to the performance of their professional duties; or encouraging others to engage in such behavior.
 * **Retaliation**. We define _retaliation_ as the imposition of any _negative consequence_ on a _member_ for their reporting of an _incident_, where _negative consequence_ is defined as any consequence that does or is intended to harm the _member's_ career.
 * **Stereotype**. We define a _stereotype_ to be a belief in the presence of a _personal attribute_ of an individual based on their perceived membership in some (unrelated or loosely related) group or category.

# Fantasyland Institute of Learning - Code Of Professionalism

Copyright &copy; 2016 Fantasyland Institute of Learning. All Rights Reserved.

## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to ensure inclusiveness and productivity in a pluralistic society. To accomplish this goal, we restrict the _community_ to peaceful people, and protect such people from _discrimination_, _stereotyping_, _harassment_, _judgmental communication_, and violations of privacy.

FCOP is explicitly not intended to impose any system of politics, morals, or values onto _members_.

## Short-Form

We welcome all peaceful people to participate in the _community_. We do not allow _discrimination_, _harassment_, _judgmental communication_, or violations of privacy. We do not exclude any peaceful people from our _community_ unless they have demonstrated an inability to follow our terms and conditions.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome peaceful people of all genders, gender-expressions, sexual-orientations, gender-orientations, races, ethnic origins, skin colors, physical handicaps, mental handicaps, ages, sizes, political views, religious views, philosophies, beliefs, and attitudes.

We pledge that we will not tolerate _discrimination_, _harassment_, _judgmental communication_, or violations of privacy. We pledge to hold ourselves to these same standards and, in so doing, set a positive example for others to follow.

We greatly value integrity and pledge to establish the highest levels of trust in _members_.

## Behavior

### Active Participation

During _active participation_, you must behave as described in this section.

* **Assume the Best**. Assume the best intention when others communicate with you. If you donâ€™t understand what someone meant, or have questions about it, ask them directly rather than speculating or spreading rumors.
* **Don't Stereotype**. Treat everyone as unique. Do not infer characteristics of a person based on their [perceived] membership in some group or category.
* **Don't Communicate Judgmentally**. You must not communicate the idea that any person, place, thing, idea, or action is superior or inferior to any other. Instead, talk about observations, models, analyses, and your own personal preferences.
* **Don't Harass**. Do not interact with anyone who does not consent. For verbal and written interaction you may assume consent for the first interaction, until the recipient communicates otherwise. For physical interaction, close physical proximity, and persistent gaze, you must assume non-consent until the person clearly and unambiguously communicates otherwise.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not go out of your way to read, watch, or listen to the private communications of other members (including trying to read their screens or listening to their private conversations). If you do overhear a private conversation do not share it on social media.
* **Don't Obstruct**. Attempts to disrupt speakers or prevent members from physically entering public spaces will not be tolerated.

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, you must behave as described in this section.

* **Be Peaceful**. Do not engage in criminal activity.
* **Don't Dox**. Do not disseminate any details about others learned within the _community_ without express permission, including but not limited to real name, address, phone number, or photo identity.
* **Don't Shame**. You must not discuss a member's behavior inside the _community_ outside of the _community_ without express permission.

## Privacy

**Private Communication**. During _active participation_, you may take phone calls, direct messages, emails, and other semi-private forms of communication. Although private communication is not bound by FCOP, we expect all communication that can be seen or overheard by other members will uphold FCOP.

**Private Consumption**. During _active participation_, you may consume material on your own personal devices and from your own channels of communication, and this material does not have to conform to FCOP, assuming the material is not easily discernible to others.

## Violations

**No Victimless Crime**. If you are a _victim_ but you do not feel victimized, you may choose to not report the _violation_.

**Reporting Process**. _Active participation_ violations must be reported to us within 15 days by Victims. Inactive Participation violations may be reported at any time, and by anyone, even non-_members_.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For minor offenses and in cases where they prefer doing so, we encourage _victims_ to speak to _violators_, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC). If you would like to do this with the help of an independent mediator, contact us and we will arrange for one.

**Official Resolution**. If you want an official intervention, we will appoint a judge. The judge will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the reported violation, or accepting it and imposing a penalty on the _violator_.

**Penalties**. _violators_ may be warned, forced into training, counseling or mediation, or ejected and banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the judge.

**Social Rehabilitation**. No one can be banished for life, only for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties can be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. Reporting a violation is a confidential process. We will not publish information on any reported incident or the parties involved in the incident. Note that criminal behavior of any kind will not be kept confidential.

## Terms

 * **Active Participation**. We define Active Participation to include the behavior of members while they are in the boundaries of the _community_.
 * **Behavior**. We define behavior to include all and only observable actions of people, and to explicitly exclude any private thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, and emotions.

 * **Community**. We define our _community_ as a group of people with a shared professional interest that exists at some location (online or geographical) and within some span of time. The boundaries of the community are dictated by us, but cannot extend in space or time to any place where we do not have the actual or legal ability to impose FCOP-prescribed penalties on _violators_.

This includes all forms of name-calling, but explicitly excludes any language that qualifies as non-violent communication (NVC).
 * **Members**. We define a member of the _community_ as a peaceful individual who we allow to actively participate in the _community_.

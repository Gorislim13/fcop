# Fantasyland Institute of Learning - Code Of Professionalism (FCOP)

Copyright &copy; 2016 - 2017 Fantasyland Institute of Learning. All Rights Reserved.

## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to facilitate inclusiveness and productivity in our _community_ despite operating in a pluralistic society. To accomplish this goal, we restrict the _community_ to _civil_ people, and protect such people from _discrimination_, _stereotyping_, _harassment_, _moralizing_, _denigration_, and _breaches of privacy_.

FCOP is explicitly not intended to impose any system of politics, religion, ideologies, morals, or values onto _members_.

## Short-Form

We welcome all _civil_ people to participate in the _community_. We do not allow _discrimination_, _harassment_, _moralizing_, _denigration_, or _breaches of privacy_. We do not exclude any _civil_ people from our _community_ unless they have been banned by us for a _violation_ of these terms and conditions.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome all _civil_ people regardless of any physical or mental characteristics orthogonal to the professional goals of the _community_, including all genders, gender-expressions, sexual-orientations, gender-orientations, races, ethnic origins, skin colors, physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, ages, sizes, political views, religious views, philosophies, beliefs, values, attitudes, and past professions.

We pledge that we will not tolerate _discrimination_, _harassment_, _moralizing_, _denigration_, or _breaches of privacy_. We pledge to hold ourselves to these same standards and, in so doing, set a positive example for others to follow.

We greatly value integrity and pledge to establish the highest levels of trust in _members_.

## Behavior

### Active Participation

During _active participation_, you must behave as described in this section.

* **Don't Stereotype**. Communicate as if every individual were unique.
* **Don't Moralize**. Do not impose your moral system or values onto others.
* **Don't Denigrate**. Do not denigrate people's physical or mental characteristics.
* **Don't Harass**. Do not interact with anyone who does not consent.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not eavesdrop on private communications of other members.

We encourage everyone to assume the best in every interaction; to be open, honest, empathic, and creative in all communication; and to demonstrate politeness and professional courtesy.

These requirements on behavior apply to _members_ only while they are actively participating in the _community_. The standing of _members_ is unaffected by behavior that does not comply with these requirements if this behavior occurs in other communities.

However, if we become aware of behavior in another community that we believe implies a _member_ may not abide by the terms and conditions of FCOP in the _community_, then we reserve the right to take proactive measures to protect other _members_, including but not limited to warning _members_ and instituting oversight or monitoring of the _member_'s behavior in the _community_.

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, you must behave as described in this section.

* **Be Civil**. Do not commit criminal offenses, and do not sabotage the _community_ or _member_'s careers.
* **Don't Dox**. Do not disseminate any private details about others learned within the _community_ without express permission, including but not limited to real name, address, phone number, or photo identity.
* **Don't Shame**. You must not negatively communicate about a member's behavior (which occurred inside the _community_, or which you learned about while inside the _community_) with anyone outside the _community_ without express permission of the discussed _members_, where the discussed _members_ themselves decide what is negative.

These requirements on behavior apply to _members_ at all times, even when they are not actively participating in the _community_.

## Privacy

**Semi-Private Communication**. During _active participation_, you may take phone calls, direct messages, emails, and other semi-private forms of communication. Although private communication with people outside of the community is not bound by FCOP, we expect all communication that can be seen or overheard by other members will comply with the requirements of FCOP.

**Private Consumption**. During _active participation_, you may consume material on your own personal devices and from your own channels of communication, and this material does not have to conform to FCOP, assuming the material is not easily discernible to others.

## Violations

**No Victimless Violations**. If you believe you have been adversely affected by a _violation_ but are not _aggrieved_, you may choose to not report the _incident_. In this case, we will not treat the incident as a violation.

**Reporting Process**. _Active participation_ incidents must be reported to us within 15 days by _aggrieved_ members, and may not be reported by third-parties. Inactive Participation incidents may be reported to us within 5 years of their occurrence, and by anyone, even non-_members_.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For minor offenses and in cases where they prefer doing so, we encourage _aggrieved_ members to speak to _accused_ members, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC). If you would like to do this with the help of an independent mediator, contact us and we will arrange for one.

**Official Resolution**. If you want an official intervention, we will appoint an arbiter (consisting of one or more persons). The arbiter will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the reported violation, or accepting it and imposing a consequence on the _accused_ member.

**Consequences**. _Violators_ may be warned, asked to apologize or undergo training, counseling, or mediation as a condition of continued participation, or ejected and banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the arbiter. In no case will the consequence for violating FCOP exceed banishment, unless the violation is also governed by a separate contractual agreement or local law.

**Social Rehabilitation**. No one can be banished for life, only for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties can be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. Reporting an incident is a confidential process. We will not publish information on any reported incident or the parties involved in the incident. Note that criminal offenses of any kind will not be kept confidential.

## Disputes

In the event there is a dispute about the meaning of any term or clause in FCOP, we alone will clarify the intent.

## Terms

 * **Accused**.  We define _accused_ as a member who has been attributed a violation by an _aggrieved_ member.
 * **Active Participation**. We define _active participation_ to include the behavior of members while they are in the boundaries of the _community_.
 * **Aggrieved**. We define _aggrieved_ as a member who believes that one or more of the following holds:
    * **Breaches of Privacy**. Someone has violated their privacy.

 * **Behavior**. We define _behavior_ to include all and only observable actions of people, and to explicitly exclude any private thoughts, beliefs, ideas, attitudes, morals, and emotions.
 * **Civil**. We define civil individuals as individuals who, in our sole estimation, do not and will not engage in the following behaviors during _active participation_ or _inactive participation_:
    * **Criminal Offenses**. Any illegal behavior considered a criminal offense in the community's country of jurisdiction.
    * **Community Sabotage**. Any behavior directed at sabotaging the community.
    * **Professional Sabotage**. Any behavior directed at sabotaging a _member_'s career for any reason that is unrelated to the _member_'s performance in their profession, including but not limited to attempting to no-platform a _member_ or pressuring an employer to fire a _member_, or encouraging others to do the same.
 * **Communication**. We define _communication_ as any transmission of information between people, including but not limited to verbal, written, electronic, pictorial, gestural, and tactile.
 * **Community**. We define our _community_ as a group of people with a shared professional interest that exists at some location (online or geographical) and within some span of time. The boundaries of the community are dictated by us, but cannot extend in space or time to any place where we do not have the actual or legal ability to impose FCOP-prescribed consequences on _violators_.
 * **Denigration**. We define _denigration_ as the _communication_ of the idea that any physical or mental characteristic of any person is superior or inferior to any other. This explicitly excludes communication of the idea that objective, falsifiable statements espoused by someone are inconsistent or unsupported or contradicted by data.
 * **Discrimination**. We define _discrimination_ as any favoritism shown or withheld to someone either on the basis of a stereotype or a non-community related group membership.
 * **Harassment**. We define _harassment_ as an _interaction_ with someone who does not consent to the interaction. For interactions of a professional nature, you may assume consent for the first interaction, until the recipient communicates otherwise (examples include handshakes, looking at someone who is speaking, providing feedback). For all other interactions, you must assume non-consent until the person clearly and unambiguously communicates otherwise (examples include persistent gaze at someone who is not speaking, sexual interactions of any kind).
 * **Inactive Participation**. We define _inactive participation_ to include the behavior of members at all times and under all circumstances.
 * **Incident**. We define _incident_ as a possible infringement of the FCOP.
 * **Interaction**. We define _interaction_ as any one-on-one communication, physical contact (with person or property), close proximity, or persistent gaze. Interaction does not include opt-in, broadcast-based communication within the Community.
 * **Members**. We define a _member_ of the community to be any civil individual who we allow to actively participate in the community.
 * **Moralizing**. We define _moralizing_ as an attempt to evangelize one's moral system or values to others, whether by communicating the idea that their moral system or values are superior to others, or by intimidating people to profess or practice their moral system or values.
 * **Stereotyping**. We define _stereotyping_ as _communication_ that implies one characteristic of an individual based on their perceived membership in some (unrelated or loosely related) group or category.
 * **Violation**. We define _violation_ as an actual infringement of the FCOP as determined by an official arbiter.
 * **Violator**. We define _violator_ as an _accused_ member who the arbiter has decided has broken the terms and conditions of FCOP.
 * **We**. We define _we_ to be those who have the actual or legal ability to impose FCOP-prescribed consequences on _violators_ within the physical or virtual boundaries of the _community_.

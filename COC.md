# Fantasyland Institute of Learning - Code Of Professionalism (FCOP)

## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to facilitate an inclusive and diverse _community_ of professionals who productively work towards common professional goals.

To facilitate these goals, we do not impose any ideology onto _members_, nor do we restrict participation based on people's _personal attributes_ or their _behavior_ in other communities. Instead, we restrict the _community_ to _civil_ individuals and we require that _members_ refrain from _unprofessional behavior_.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome all _civil_ individuals regardless of any _personal attributes_ they have that are orthogonal to the professional goals of the _community_.

We pledge that we will enforce the terms and conditions set forth in FCOP, and that we will hold ourselves to these same standards, thereby setting a positive example for others to follow.

## Behavior

We permit only _civil_ individuals to participate in the _community_. We further require that _members_ refrain from _unprofessional behavior_.

### Active Participation

We encourage everyone to assume the best in every interaction; to be open, honest, and empathic in all _communication_; and to demonstrate politeness and professional courtesy in every situation.

We welcome any closed group of _members_ to engage in any _behavior_ for which there is explicit and unanimous mutual consent. In the absence of such consent, we impose the following restrictions during _active participation_, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Harass**. Do not _interact_ with anyone who does not consent to the _interaction_.
* **Don't Stereotype**. _Communicate_ as if every person were unique.
* **Don't Discriminate**. Do not show or withhold favoritism on the basis of a _stereotype_.
* **Don't Denigrate**. Do not denigrate the _personal attributes_ of others.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not eavesdrop on the private content or _communication_ of others.
* **Don't Moralize**. Do not impose your moral system onto other others.

These requirements on _behavior_ apply to _members_ only while they are actively participating in the _community_. The standing of _members_ is unaffected by _behavior_ that does not comply with these requirements if this _behavior_ occurs in other communities.

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, you must behave as required in this section, and as further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Dox**. Do not disseminate _personal attributes_ you learn about _members_ in the course of _active participation_.
* **Don't Retaliate**. Do not _retaliate_ against _aggrieved members_ for reporting an _incident_.

These requirements on _behavior_ apply to _members_ at all times, even when they are not actively participating in the _community_.

## Reporting

**Reporting Requirements**. _Active participation incidents_ must be reported to us within 15 days by _aggrieved members_. We will investigate third-party reports at our sole discretion. _Inactive participation incidents_ must be reported to us within 5 years of their occurrence, by _members_ or _non-members_. Information that any _member_ or _non-member_ believes may affect our view of the _civility_ of individuals may be reported at any time.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For minor _incidents_, and only in cases where they prefer doing so, we encourage _aggrieved members_ to speak to _accused members_ directly, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC).

**Official Resolution**. For official resolution, _aggrieved members_ may contact us, and we will appoint an _arbiter_. The _arbiter_ will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the _incident_, or accepting it as a _violation_ and imposing a consequence on the _violator_.

**Consequences**. _Violators_ may be asked to apologize or to undergo training, counseling, or mediation as a condition of continued participation. They may also be ejected and banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the _arbiter_. In no case will the consequence for violating FCOP exceed banishment, unless the violation is also governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws. We reserve the right to re-evaluate a previously imposed _consequence_ based on new information or a change in community leadership.

**Social Rehabilitation**. We will only banish individuals for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties can be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. We may publicly share information about any _violation_ that results in banishment, including personally identifiable information on the violator, limited to name and online identities. We will keep other _incidents_ and the identities of _aggrieved_ and _accused_ confidential to the extent this confidentiality is respected by other parties.

## Rights

**Right to Contact Leaders**. _Members_ have a right to clear, up-to-date contact information for use in reporting _incidents_. _Members_ have a right to accurate estimation of how quickly _members_ will receive a response after an _incident_ is reported.

**Right to Know Boundaries**. _Members_ have a right to clear communication on the boundaries of the _community_. In addition, if any regions in time or space are specially exempted from part or all of FCOP, _members_ have a right to clear communication on these exemptions.

**Right to Semi-Private Communication**. During _active participation_, _members_ have a right to take phone calls, direct messages, emails, and other semi-private forms of _communication_. Although private _communication_ with people outside of the community is not bound by FCOP, all _communication_ that can be discerned by other members must comply with the requirements of FCOP.

**Right to Private Consumption**. During _active participation_, _members_ have a right to consume material on their own personal devices and from their own private channels of _communication_, and this material does not have to conform to FCOP, assuming the material is not easily discernible to others.

**Right to Non-Coercion**. _Members_ have a right to not be coerced to share private information, make statements, or otherwise perform any function that is not essential for the scope of participating in a given _community_ activity.

**Right to Disclosure**. Individuals who are banished from the _community_ or who are prevented from participation on grounds of incivility have a right to a full written disclosure of the arbitration, evidence, or rationale. Such individuals have the right to publicly share this disclosure without further repercussions from the _community_.

## Miscellaneous

**Criminal Behavior**. FCOP is not intended to supplant laws and regulations of governing jurisdictions, but rather, to impose a set of terms and conditions on membership in a community that goes above and beyond legal requirements. _Criminal behavior_ of any kind should be immediately reported to relevant authorities and dealt with as recommended by such authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if _criminal behavior_ also violates terms and conditions of FCOP, we reserve the right to subject such behavior to arbitration.

**Interpretive Disputes**. In the event there is a dispute about the meaning of any term or clause in FCOP, we alone will clarify the intent. We pledge to be consistent in our interpretation of any ambiguity, rather than utilizing different interpretations in different circumstances.

 * **Community Sabotage**. We define _community sabotage_ to be any _behavior_ that does have or is intended to have the effect of harming the professional goals of the _community_, including but not limited to attempting to defund or blackball the _community_, attempting to disrupt or diminish the activities of the _community_, and authoring, spreading, or endorsing libel or slander about the _community_; or encouraging others to do the same.

Explicitly excluded from _professional sabotage_ is any harmful _behavior_ that is exclusively motivated by and _communicated_ in terms of the _member_'s failure to fulfill their professional duties.
 * **Retaliation**. We define _retaliation_ as the imposition of any _negative consequence_ on a _member_ for their reporting of an _incident_, where _negative consequence_ is defined as any consequence that does or is intended to harm the _member's_ career.
